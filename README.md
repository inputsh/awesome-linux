Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) - all of it free. It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian -- carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together. 

**Latest version:** Debian Stretch (9.6)

**Default Desktop Environment:** GNOME

![default look](http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/debian.png)

#### [Mageia](http://www.mageia.org/)

> Mageia is a fork of Mandriva Linux formed in September 2010 by former employees and contributors to the popular French Linux distribution.

Operating on a rolling release system, Arch can be installed from a CD image or via an FTP server. The default install provides a solid base that enables users to create a custom installation. In addition, the Arch Build System (ABS) provides a way to easily build new packages, modify the configuration of stock packages, and share these packages with other users via the Arch Linux user repository.

**Latest version:** Not applicable (Rolling Release system)

**Default Desktop Environment:** Not applicable (there's no default Desktop environment)

### Special Purpose

#### [CoreOS](https://coreos.com/)

**Specialty:** Clusters

> CoreOS is a Linux-based operating system for servers.

#### [Puppy Linux](http://puppylinux.org/)

**Specialty:** Low system requirements

> Puppy Linux is yet another Linux distribution. What's different here is that Puppy is extraordinarily small, yet quite full-featured. Puppy boots into a ramdisk and, unlike live CD distributions that have to keep pulling stuff off the CD, it loads into RAM. This means that all applications start in the blink of an eye and respond to user input instantly. Puppy Linux has the ability to boot off a flash card or any USB memory device, CDROM, Zip disk or LS/120/240 Superdisk, floppy disks, internal hard drive. It can even use a multisession formatted CD-RW/DVD-RW to save everything back to the CD/DVD with no hard drive required at all.

#### [Ubuntu Studio](http://ubuntustudio.org/)

**Specialty:** Multimedia creation

> Ubuntu Studio is a variant of Ubuntu aimed at the GNU/Linux audio, video and graphic enthusiast as well as professional. The distribution provides a collection of open-source applications available for multimedia creation.

#### [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html)

**Specialty:** Incognito live system

> Tails is a live system that aims to preserve your privacy and anonymity. It helps you to use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship almost anywhere you go and on any computer but leaving no trace unless you ask it to explicitly. It is a complete operating system designed to be used from a USB stick or a DVD independently of the computer's original operating system. It is Free Software and based on Debian GNU/Linux. Tails comes with several built-in applications pre-configured with security in mind: web browser, instant messaging client, email client, office suite, image and sound editor, etc.
